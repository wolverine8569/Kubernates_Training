* Assignment 1
Q. Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.

Replica set is used to ensure that defined set of Pods are running all the time. It is used to ensure that all nodes are running the copy of pod. They are commonly used for logging and monitoring for hosts, for example a node needs a service which collects the voting data and stores into database.
if you want to get data from each node, the best option is to schedule a container on every node that will gather these data from each individual node. 
if we schedule one container to gather data from all nodes, there is a risk of loosing from whole cluster when any node from whatever reason dies, but having a copy of the same container on every node will help.


*Assignment 2
Q. Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.

step1 : kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 10}}'
step2 : kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2

*Assignment 3
Q. You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.

check node port,IP,specs,labels,selector, in YAML file
check the syntax

*Assignment 4
Q. VOTING APP -DEMO practical

Commands : 
	git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app
	cd example-voting-app/
	cd k8s-specifications/
	kubectl apply -f . 
	kubectl get svc

1)delete vote pod :
	kubectl delete pod vote-94849dc97-82blj
	kubectl get pod

Observations : 
	new container get created
	still voting app is accessible
	no problem in no. of votes
	voting app, redis app, worker app, db app and result app worked fine
	for large application for continuity we can scale the deployment

2) delete worker pod 
	kubectl delete pod worker-dd46d7584-xhq4j
	kubectl get pod
	kubectl logs worker-dd46d7584-k6chc

Observations : 
	still voting app is accessible
	no problem in no. of votes
	worker app able to pull the data
	system flow is not disturbed
	voting app, redis app, worker app, db app and result app worked fine
	while new worker app is coming logs got deleted	

3) delete db pod 	
	kubectl delete pod db-b54cd94f4-kxk7l
	kubectl get pod
	kubectl logs result-5d57b59f4b-tvvkh

Observations : 
	impact on records, data got deleted
	new db pod able to connect and do the insertion of votes
	connection to result app is ended by db app
	socket is not established
	impact on result shown on screen i.e result app

4) To Start the result app => the socket should be established
				i.e restart the result app
				kubectl delete pod result-5d57b59f4b-tvvkh
				
	Logs after Deleteing Db pod

Observations : 
	now result app is working , showing the results
	Logs after restarting result app pod

Kubernetes supports Stateless application
take care of data, Kubernetes doesn't support data
